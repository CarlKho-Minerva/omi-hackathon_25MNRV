2.  **Live Your Day with Omi:**  Simply wear your Omi device and engage in your day as usual.  Omi Daily Wrapped works silently in the background, automatically capturing and processing your conversations.
3.  **Nightly Reflection - Access Your Daily Insights:**  Around [Your Scheduled Time, e.g., 9:00 PM Pacific Time] (or whenever you prefer to reflect on your day):
    *   Open the **Omi mobile app** on your phone.
    *   Navigate to your list of **installed apps**.
    *   **Tap the "Omi Daily Wrapped" app icon.**
    *   Omi will instantly launch your personalized Daily Reflection web application in your device's browser.
4.  **Swipe and Reflect:**  Effortlessly swipe vertically through the beautifully designed story slides, immersing yourself in your daily reflection:
    *   **Intro Slide:**  Set the mood with the daily emoji and summary.
    *   **Gratitude Journal:**  Review and appreciate the positive moments highlighted.
    *   **Knowledge Gap Filled:**  Reinforce your learning by reviewing new terms and definitions.
    *   **It's the Little Things:**  Consider the subtle cues and suggested actions.
    *   **Mentor Advice:**  Absorb the personalized guidance from your AI mentor.
    *   **Task List:**  Review, curate, and copy your action items.
5.  **Copy Action Items to Your Task Manager:**  On the "Task List" slide, review the automatically generated tasks, check the boxes next to the ones you want to act on, and tap the **"Copy Selected Tasks"** button.  Paste the formatted markdown list into Notion, Todoist, or your preferred to-do app to seamlessly integrate your reflection insights into your daily workflow.

**Important Note on Notifications (Proof of Concept Limitation):**

For this Proof of Concept hackathon submission, Omi Daily Wrapped is designed to be accessed on-demand via the **Omi App Home URL**.  Currently, the application **does not implement automatic push notifications** to proactively remind you to view your daily reflection.  While push notifications are a highly desirable feature for future iterations to further enhance user engagement and convenience, the focus for this hackathon has been on building the core reflection engine, the visual story experience, and the seamless data flow.  Exploring and implementing push notifications (potentially via Web Push APIs or future Omi-provided notification channels) remains a key area for future development and enhancement.


## Get Started (For Developers - Replicating this Project)

Ready to build your own personalized Daily Reflection app for Omi? Follow these steps to replicate the project setup and deployment:

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account:** You'll need a GCP account with billing enabled to deploy and run the backend services (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Firestore, Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Storage).  Consider exploring the GCP Free Tier for initial development and testing.
2.  **Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) Installed and Configured:** Ensure you have the `gcloud` command-line tool installed and configured to access your GCP project. See the [official gcloud installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
3.  **Docker Desktop:** Docker is required to build and push the container image for the Cloud Run API service. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
4.  **Omi Dev Kit (Optional but Recommended for Full Testing):** While you can develop and test parts of the application without a physical Omi device, having an Omi Dev Kit will allow you to fully test the end-to-end integration with real conversation data and webhook triggers. You can request a Dev Kit through the Omi hackathon channels.
5.  **OpenAI API Key:**  You will need an API key from OpenAI to utilize the GPT-3.5 Turbo model for conversation analysis and content generation. Obtain an API key from the [OpenAI Platform website](https://platform.openai.com/). Ensure you have billing set up for your OpenAI account.
6.  **Notion API Integration (Optional, for Task Export Feature Extension):** While the core POC focuses on clipboard copy for task export, future integration with the Notion API (or other task management APIs) would require creating a Notion Integration and obtaining an API key.  See the [Notion API documentation](https://developers.notion.com/) for details.
7.  **Python 3.10+ and `pip`:** Ensure you have Python 3.10 or a later version installed on your development machine, along with `pip`, the Python package installer.
8.  **VS Code (Recommended IDE):**  While any code editor can be used, VS Code is highly recommended for Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS development and provides excellent terminal integration for running `gcloud` and Docker commands.
9.  **Node.js and npm (Optional, for Frontend Dependency Management):** While the frontend dependencies in this POC are included via CDN links for simplicity, for more complex frontend development, you might want to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to manage JavaScript libraries and potentially use a frontend build toolchain.

**Clone the Repository (GitHub - [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL_HERE]):**

1.  **Clone the GitHub Repository:** If the project code is available on GitHub (replace `[YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL_HERE]` with your actual repository URL), clone it to your local machine using Git in your terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL_HERE]
    cd omi-daily-wrapped  # Or the name of your cloned repository folder
```

cd omi-wrapped  # Repository folder name

# Set up environment variables

  --region us-west2 \
  --timeout 540s \
  --memory 256Mi \
  --gen2
```

#### 3. Set Up Cloud Scheduler:

```bash
# Create a daily trigger (9 PM Pacific Time)
gcloud scheduler jobs create http omi-daily-reflection-job \
  --schedule="0 21 * * *" \
  --time-zone="America/Los_Angeles" \
  --uri="https://us-west2-[YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID].cloudfunctions.net/daily-reflection-processor" \
  --http-method=GET \
  --location us-west2
```

### Frontend Deployment:
